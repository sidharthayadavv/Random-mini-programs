# Random-mini-programs
I am creating this repo for random mini programs which are very redundant.

### Projects so far:

* VimHelloWorld is basically the first program I wrote on vim, editor. Not much but I am trying to learn vim motions.
* Decimal to Binary is a program to convert decimal number into binary.
  * **Language Used:** Java
* cliInC is where I am learning to use command line interface inputs and outputs. This is my learning project to implement CLI.
  * **Language Used:** C
